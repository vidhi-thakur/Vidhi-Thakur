### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Vidhi Thakur

I am a software developer with a passion for building innovative solutions that solve complex problems. With a strong background in frontend technologies such as NextJS, ReactJS, and JS, I have experience developing and integrating OTP authentication, an interface to book a call with consultants, etc.

What sets me apart is my keen interest in communication. I enjoy collaborating with other team members to understand their needs and  I am committed to clear, concise, and effective communication.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a book or playing table tennis. I believe that a well-rounded perspective is essential to being an effective communicator and problem solver.
